## Stewardship Scope

HALMark evaluates AI systems across three risk domains:

1. Structural Risk — Syntax, entity validity, configuration integrity.
2. Systemic Risk — Performance traps, recursive loops, listener explosion.
3. Operational Risk — Blast radius errors, destructive suggestions, ambiguity without clarification.

HALMark is not a linter.
It is a stewardship certification framework for AI systems modifying Home Assistant.
